#Gitso is to support others.
#----------------------------------------

#Prerequisites: 
sudo apt-get install x11vnc xtightvncviewer

#Installation:
chmod +x ./gitso.py

#Run:
./gitso.py

#Description:
# We created Gitso as a GUI wrapper to create a reverse VNC connection. It is meant to be easy enough so the 
# person who needs help can get it.  They run this program and type in the IP address given to them by their
# friend offering support.  The person who is giving support needs to have port 5500 open to their machine.
