Gitso is to support others. We created Gitso as a GUI wrapper to create a reverse VNC connection. It is meant to be easy enough so that the person who needs help, runs this program and types in the IP address of someone who is also running Gitso in the “give support” mode. The person who is giving support needs to have port 5500 open to their machine.
