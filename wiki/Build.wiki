If you are just curious about using Gitso, there is no need to build it from Source. Please see the [http://code.google.com/p/gitso/downloads/list Downloads Page].

If you're interested in digging around in the code or submitting a patch, I'd recommend grabbing a snapshot from [http://code.google.com/p/gitso/source/checkout SVN]. 
Patches are definitely welcome! However, if you want to create a specialized build for yourself, I'd recomment download the [http://gitso.googlecode.com/files/gitso_0.6_src.tar.bz2 latest stable version of the source].
