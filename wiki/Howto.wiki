First, the person giving support needs to:

  # Launch Gitso.
  # Click on "Give Support"
  # Click "Connect"

Second, the person who needs help, needs to:
  
  # Launch Gitso.
  # Click on "Get Help"
  # Type in the "IP Address" provided by the supporter
  # Click "Connect"
   
Now the person who needs help sits back and watches as someone else moves their mouse and operates their pc from afar.  

Note: The person who is giving support needs to have port 5500 open to their machine which requires a port forward on a NATed network.

==FAQ==
 Q. I want to help someone, but I’m behind a router, and it doesn’t work!

 A. The person who is going to “give support” must have port 5500 open to their PC. This usually means enabling port forwarding on your router and poking holes through any firewalls.

==Advanced==
There are a number of command line switches that Gitso supports.
  * *--dev* This should be used when calling gitso from the source. This enables the code to look in the appropriate place for various assets.
  * *--listen* Gitso will start and automatically listen for connections (AKA give support)..
  * *--connect IP* Gitso will start and automatically try to connect to the IP address.
  * *--list list_file* Gitso will look to this external list, can be local or via HTTP for the hosts lists. Ex: You could add a list to your web server so every time the user connected with this option, they would get an up-to-date support list from your server.
  * *--version* Show the current release of Gitso.
  * *--help* Show these options.
